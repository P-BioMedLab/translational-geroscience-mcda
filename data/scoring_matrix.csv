5,"Consistent, significant (>10%) median lifespan extension in at least two mammalian species, with positive effects in both sexes.","Broad, robust improvements across multiple (≥3) healthspan domains demonstrated in multiple mammalian species.","Core pathway components and function are ubiquitously conserved across all eukaryotes, with clear orthologs and functional equivalence.","High-certainty evidence from multiple, large, low-risk-of-bias RCTs showing a clinically meaningful benefit on an age-related indication; FDA-approved for a relevant chronic condition.","FDA-approved for a chronic condition with decades of widespread use (>10M patients). Side effect profile is well-characterized, predominantly mild, and non-life-threatening. No black box warnings.","A validated, non-invasive biomarker is routinely used in clinical practice or trials to measure direct target engagement and dose-response.",Very low cost (<$1/day). Widely available over-the-counter or as a generic drug. Simple oral administration.
4,"Consistent, significant (>10%) median lifespan extension in multiple independent studies in one mammalian species, with positive effects in both sexes.","Broad, robust improvements across two healthspan domains demonstrated in at least one mammalian species.",Pathway is highly conserved across all vertebrates with clear functional equivalence in key regulatory nodes.,"Moderate-certainty evidence from at least one large, low-risk-of-bias RCT or multiple smaller RCTs showing a clinically meaningful benefit.","Long-term use for a chronic condition in large populations (>1M patients). Side effects are well-known, mostly mild-to-moderate, and reversible.","A reliable, non-invasive biomarker exists and has been validated in multiple Phase 2/3 trials to show dose-dependent target engagement.",Low cost (<$5/day). Available as a generic prescription drug. Simple oral administration.
3,"Significant (>5%) median lifespan extension in at least two independent studies in mice, but effects may be sex- or strain-specific.",Consistent improvements demonstrated in one major healthspan domain in mammalian models.,"Pathway is conserved across metazoans, though some components may have diverged.",Low-certainty evidence from small or moderate-risk-of-bias RCTs suggesting a benefit on a primary aging/healthspan endpoint.,Approved for a chronic condition with a well-understood safety profile. Common side effects are moderate but manageable. Low incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs).,"A non-invasive biomarker has been shown to be responsive to the intervention in a Phase 2 trial, but requires further validation.",Moderate cost (<$20/day). Available as a branded prescription drug with good insurance coverage.
2,"Significant (>5%) median lifespan extension in a single mouse study, or consistent, robust extension only in invertebrate models.","Positive effects on multiple healthspan metrics reported, but results are not yet replicated, or broad improvements only in invertebrate models.","Pathway is conserved in mammals, but its role in invertebrates is unclear or different.",Very low-certainty evidence from high-risk-of-bias RCTs or observational studies for surrogate endpoints.,Used clinically for an acute or intermittent indication. Side effects can be significant but are predictable and manageable in a clinical setting.,"A reliable biomarker exists but requires a minimally invasive procedure (e.g., tissue biopsy) to measure target engagement.","High cost (<$100,000/year). Requires specialist prescription and monitoring. May require injection or infusion."
1,"Inconsistent or modest lifespan extension in mammals, or evidence suggests negative/null effect. No direct evidence.","Inconsistent or modest healthspan improvements in mammals, or evidence suggests negative/null effect. No direct evidence.",Pathway is specific to a particular lineage or its role in aging is highly speculative.,No human trials completed or planned. Only preclinical or observational data exists.,"Significant safety concerns based on mechanism of action. High potential for severe, irreversible side effects. Known toxicity in humans.","No established biomarkers. Measurement of effect relies on complex, experimental assays.","Prohibitively high cost (>$100,000/year). Complex administration (e.g., gene therapy). Highly restricted access."
