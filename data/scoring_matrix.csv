5,"Large lifespan extension (≥15%) in mammalian models with reproducible findings across multiple studies, OR exceptional extension (≥30%) in conserved model organisms with reproducible findings.","Broad, robust improvements across multiple (≥3) healthspan domains demonstrated in multiple mammalian species.","High-certainty evidence from multiple, large, low-risk-of-bias RCTs showing a clinically meaningful benefit on an age-related indication; FDA-approved for a relevant chronic condition.","Core pathway components and function are ubiquitously conserved across all eukaryotes, with clear orthologs and functional equivalence.","FDA-approved for a chronic condition with decades of widespread use (>10M patients). Side effect profile is well-characterized, predominantly mild, and non-life-threatening. No black box warnings.",Very low cost (<$1/day). Widely available over-the-counter or as a generic drug. Simple oral administration.
4,"Significant (≥10%) median lifespan extension in multiple independent studies in mammalian species, OR Interventions showing high magnitude (≥20%) in single mammalian studies.","Broad, robust improvements across two healthspan domains demonstrated in at least one mammalian species.","Moderate-certainty evidence from at least one large, low-risk-of-bias RCT or multiple smaller RCTs showing a clinically meaningful benefit.",Pathway is highly conserved across all vertebrates with clear functional equivalence in key regulatory nodes.,"Long-term use for a chronic condition in large populations (>1M patients). Side effects are well-known, mostly mild-to-moderate, and reversible.",Low cost (<$5/day). Available as a generic prescription drug. Simple oral administration.
3,"Moderate to robust lifespan extension (5-10%) in mammalian models with strong reproducibility, OR substantial extension (10-20%) in mammalian models from single landmark studies.",Consistent improvements demonstrated in one major healthspan domain in mammalian models.,Low-certainty evidence from small or moderate-risk-of-bias RCTs suggesting a benefit on a primary aging/healthspan endpoint.,"Pathway is conserved across metazoans, though some components may have diverged.",Approved for a chronic condition with a well-understood safety profile. Common side effects are moderate but manageable. Low incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs).,Moderate cost (<$20/day). Available as a branded prescription drug with good insurance coverage.
2,"Modest lifespan extension (0-5%) in mammalian models with reproducibility, OR moderate effects (5-10%) in single mammalian studies, OR substantial effects in invertebrate models (5-10%), OR effects observed only in transgenic/progeroid models.","Positive effects on multiple healthspan metrics reported, but results are not yet replicated, or broad improvements only in invertebrate models.",Very low-certainty evidence from high-risk-of-bias RCTs or observational studies for surrogate endpoints.,"Pathway is conserved in mammals, but its role in invertebrates is unclear or different.",Used clinically for an acute or intermittent indication. Side effects can be significant but are predictable and manageable in a clinical setting.,"High cost (<$100,000/year). Requires specialist prescription and monitoring. May require injection or infusion."
1,"Inconsistent, or evidence suggests negative/null effect. ","Inconsistent or modest healthspan improvements in mammals, or evidence suggests negative/null effect. No direct evidence.",No human trials completed or planned. Only preclinical or observational data exists.,Pathway is specific to a particular lineage or its role in aging is highly speculative.,"Significant safety concerns based on mechanism of action. High potential for severe, irreversible side effects. Known toxicity in humans.","Prohibitively high cost (>$100,000/year). Complex administration (e.g., gene therapy). Highly restricted access."
